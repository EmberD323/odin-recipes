    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are my Caprese Flatbreads and they're the perfect stuffed flatbread recipe to make as a side dish on a summer's day! Stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes, basil, feta, cream cheese, and mozzarella, they're such a treat. You only need 2 ingredients for the bread, so let's get to it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g Self raising flour</li>
        <li>180g Greek yoghurt</li>
        <li>150g Sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>30g Basil</li>
        <li>75g Feta</li>
        <li>75g Cream cheese</li>
        <li>75g Mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add your self-raising flour and Greek yoghurt. Mix with chopsticks, a wooden spoon, or your hands and then gently knead for one minute on a floured surface until you have a bouncy soft dough. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Set the dough back in the bowl and cover with cling film and set aside while you make your filling.</li>
        <li>Place all of your filling ingredients into a bowl and combine thoroughly. Taste and season according to your preferences. Set your filling mixture aside.</li>
        <li>Once your dough has rested, knead it again for 10 seconds and then slice it into four equal-sized pieces. Take one dough ball and lightly flatten with your fingers into a 3-4 inch circle until it's around ½ inch thick. Place a large tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the dough and then bring in all corners of the dough into the centre, around the caprese mixture, and pinch and seal the parcel. Turn the parcel over face down and flatten out the dough with your fingers until the flatbread is a larger circle, and around ½ inch thick. Set aside with a sprinkling of flour and repeat for the other flatbreads (see step by step images further up the blog if you need help).</li>
        <li>Place a non-stick dry pan on medium to high heat. Gently place your flatbreads into the pan and dry fry for 3-5 minutes on each side. Keep an eye on them and flip them over when they go golden-brown, soft, and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine your sun-dried tomato oil, finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and basil in a small bowl for when you're ready to serve. Serve while they're warm or once they've cooled down with your sundried tomato basil oil, enjoy!</li>
